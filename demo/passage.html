  <strong>Moving to the Back of </strong><strong>Beyond</strong></span>
  <br/>When my parents said the three of us were moving out to California, to a place just north of Los Angeles, my mind
  immediately went to thoughts of Disneyland and Hollywood, glitz and glamour. I imagined a Rodeo Drive shopping spree to
  pick out a bikini for the endless days I would be spending on the beach. However, I’d forgotten about my parents’ penchant
  for the unconventional; they’re definitely “the road less traveled” kind of people. Mom had a gopher snake for a pet when
  she was younger, and Dad was never happier than when he was climbing near-vertical cliffs that only mountain goats could
  love. These are not city folk.<br/>They had chosen to buy a 900-square-foot cabin under a <strong>250</strong>-year-old
  oak tree in the high
  <strong>chaparral<sup>1</sup></strong> forest out in the back of beyond -- so far away from Los Angeles that you couldn’t
  even see the glow of the lights at night. When I first saw where we were going to live, I vacillated between feeling terrified
  and excited. This would be an adventure, for sure. But this was no camping trip where you could go home to civilization
  after a few days of roughing it; this <em>was</em> home, and roughing it was the new normal.
  <br/> On move-in day, we drove fifteen miles out from Antelope Valley -- where the nearest grocery store was located --
  on a two-lane road past llamas, cattle, and horses. Up and up we went, until finally we turned down a dirt road and headed
  into a canyon full of towering Coulter pines, blue-green sagebrush, and ancient canyon <strong>live</strong> oaks. I didn’t
  know the names of these plants then, of course; I learned them later. That first day all I saw then was a million shades
  of green.
  <br/> We parked under an oak tree that shaded our cabin and a front yard of rock, sand, and sagebrush twice as large as
  the cabin itself. On the stone staircase that led to the front door, black lizards interrupted their push-ups to twist
  their heads and eye us as we passed. Scrub jays squawked and hummingbirds zoomed past the eaves, scolding us with their
  territorial calls.
  <br/> No cars roared past. No radios blared from a neighbor’s house. There were no neighbors—no human neighbors, anyway.<br/>Our
  new home consisted of one bedroom, one bathroom, and one big room for everything else. A fireplace in the corner of the
  big room would be our sole source of heat in the winter. A swamp box (cooler) would blow a breeze over a big damp pad to
  keep us cool all summer, or so my father said. But it was early autumn that day, and the temperature was perfect in the
  shade of the oak tree. <strong>Our</strong> oak tree, I thought; I was settling in.
  <br/>
  <br/> Mom wiped a layer of grime off the kitchen counter and muttered about getting a bottle of bleach on our next trip
  into town. That was the beginning of an important lesson about living in the back of beyond: you don’t just zip over to
  the local convenience store anytime you need something out here. You have to make a careful list and check it twice so
  that you don’t forget anything, because anywhere is a long way from here.

  <br/> On my first walk around the property, I saw two horned toads, a red-tailed hawk, and some deer tracks. I wondered
  what else I might find deeper and higher in the canyon. Dad told me the real estate agent had mentioned that coyotes, bobcats,
  mountain lions, rattlesnakes, and even bears roamed these hills. To my surprise, I found I couldn’t wait to see them. All
  of them. I felt my feet taking root in the earth, claiming this place as home.

  <br/>With no street lamps timed to turn on at sunset, when night came it was darker than anything I had ever experienced.
  Mom and I went out to look at the stars while Dad tried to unplug the ancient toilet. In the city, or even in the suburbs
  where I had lived before, you could see only the brightest stars in the sky. But out here, it was like being in a planetarium,
  except there were no labels typed onto our sky. The sheer number and spread of stars was awe-inspiring.<br/>That first
  night, we slept on air mattresses on the living room floor because the movers had not yet arrived. There were no curtains
  on the windows, so when the moon rose, it shone in as if moonbeams were an integral part of the cabin. <br/>Eventually,
  I moved into the bedroom and Mom and Dad got a foldout bed for the living room. Over the next few months, I began to count
  the passage of time in full moons rather than by the pages of a calendar, and for the first time I really noticed the days
  growing shorter in winter and longer in summer. <br/>It’s hard to believe, but we’ve been here for six years now. I’ve
  been going to school in the valley, but I feel most at home up here with my wild fellow canyon dwellers. Soon, I will have
  to leave home for college, and I’m a little afraid of the culture shock I’m sure I will feel when I move back to civilization.
  Soon I’ll be walking on pavement and well-mowed grass again, rooming with strangers, and eating meals in a cafeteria crowded
  with more people than live within twenty miles of this house. But I know I will come back. The back of beyond is home now<br/>.
